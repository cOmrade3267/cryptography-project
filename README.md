# ceaser cypher

## Overview
CryptoProject is a C++ application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a simple substitution cipher. The project also includes functionalities for brute force attacks and frequency analysis to decrypt ciphertext without a known key.

## Features
- **Encrypt Text:** Encrypt any given text using a specified key.
- **Decrypt Text:** Decrypt any given ciphertext using a specified key.
- **Brute Force Attack:** Attempt to decrypt ciphertext by trying all possible keys.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Analyze the frequency of characters in the ciphertext and attempt to decrypt based on character frequency.
